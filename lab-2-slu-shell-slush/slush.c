//SLUSH - The SLU SHELL
//
//This assignment reads user input, and executes that input as a sequence of
//programs to execute.
//
//Program execution commands have the form:
//
//prog_n [args] ( ... prog_3 [args] ( prog_2 [args] ( prog_1 [args]
//
//For example, "grep slush ( sort -r ( ls -l -a" returns a reverse sorted list
//of all files in the current directory that contain the string "slush" in
//
//See the lab writeup for more details and other requirements.
