Sleeper's PID is: 26572
Slept for 0 iterations!

2.
The numberic value is 2. It terminates the process and interrupt program

3.
The sleeping process in the first terminal terminates. 
SIGINT (signal 2) is sent via the kill and has  effect as pressing CTRL-C.

I chose the SIGHUP action (numeric value of 1)
Sleeper's PID is: 30238

Both the sleeper and the caller processes terminate and no success message is printed.

Code:
//A simple program that fork()s and exec()s the ./sleep program

#include <unistd.h> //fork(), execvp(), perror(), waidpid() 
#include <stdlib.h> //For exit()
#include <stdio.h> //For printf()
#include <signal.h> // For signal

void ignore_sigint( int signum ){
    printf("\n[Caller] WARNING: Ignoring SIGINT (Signal number %d).\n", signum);
}

int main( int argc, char* argv[] ){

		pid_t ret;

	if (signal(SIGINT, ignore_sigint) == SIG_ERR) {
        perror("Could not set signal handler");
        exit(-1);
    }

		printf("Forking sleeper...\n");	

		ret = fork();
		if( ret == -1 ){
		perror("Could not fork");
		exit(-1);
		} 

		if( ret == 0 ){ //Child
			int exec_ret;
			char* cmd = "./sleep";
			char* myargv[] = {"sleep", NULL};
			exec_ret = execvp( cmd, myargv );
			if( exec_ret == -1 ){
				perror("Error calling execvp");
				exit(-1);

	//Parent
	printf("Waiting for sleeper %d...\n", ret);
	waitpid( ret, NULL, 0 );

	printf("Parent finished waiting and returned successfully!\n");


	return 0;

An example is a web server is running, and an administrator needs to change a setting.
With signals, the server program is able to complete the task  without stoping the entire server.

Optional:

1.
Nothing changes on the empty terminal command line. It just moves to a new line.

This is important because like the example from question 7, a terminal is designed to stoping
when the user clicks the red x in the corner. It uses a SIGNIT handler to ignore ethe signal so 
that the user does not close their terminal by mistake.
